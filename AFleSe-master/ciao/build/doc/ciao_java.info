Prolog/Java Bidirectional Interface
***********************************

This manual includes the complete reference to the low-level Prolog to
Java interface.  This interface allows a Prolog program to start a Java
process and manipulate Java objects.

In this document we present an interface between Ciao Prolog and Java to
take advantage of the capabilities of the java programming language,
avoiding problems related to compile-time linking, system dependencies,
and static references.  This interface fully achieves the objectives
using a simple but powerful protocol between both languages.  The
communication is established by means of sockets, allowing the processes
to be in separated machines, and thus providing a means for distributed
processing.

Introduction
************

The increasing diversity of platforms used today and the diffusion of
Internet and the World Wide Web makes compatibility between platforms a
key factor to run the software everywhere with no change.  Java seems to
achieve this goal, using a bytecode intermediate language and a large
library of platform-dependent and independent classes which fully
implements many.  On the other hand, Prolog provides a powerful
implementation of logic programming paradigm.  This document includes
the reference manual of the Prolog/Java bidirectional interface
implemented in Ciao.  In addition, it has been developed an application
of this interface that makes use of an object oriented extension of
Prolog to encapsulate the java classes, O'Ciao, both the ones defined in
the JDK as well as new classes developed in Java.  These classes can be
used in the object oriented prolog extension of Ciao just like native
O'Ciao classes.

The proposed interaction between both languages is realized as an
interface between two processes, a Java process and a Prolog process,
running separately.  This approach allows the programmer to use of both
Java and Prolog, without the compiler-dependent glue code used in other
linkage-oriented approaches, and preserves the philosophy of Java as an
independent language.  The interface communication is based on a clean
socket-based protocol, providing hardware and software independence.
This allows also both processes to be run in different machines
connected by a TCP/IP transport protocol, based on a client/server model
that can evolve to a more cooperative model.

The present manual includes reference information about the Prolog side
of the bidirectional Java/Prolog interface.  The Java side of this
interface is explained in the HTML pages generated by Javadoc.

Distributed Programming Model
=============================

The differences between Prolog and Java impose the division of the
interface in two main parts: a prolog-to-java and a java-to-prolog
interfaces.  Most of the applications that will use this interface will
consider that will be a "client' side that request actions and queries
to a "server' side, which accomplish the actions and answer the queries.
In a first approach, any of the both one-way interfaces implement a pure
client/server model: the server waits for a query, performs the received
query and sleeps until the next query comes; the client starts the
server, carries out the initial part of the job initiating all the
conversations with the server, and requests the server to do some things
sometimes.

This model cannot handle correctly the tasks regarding an event oriented
programming environment like java.  A usual application of the
prolog-to-java interface could be a graphical user interface server made
in java, and a prolog client on the other side.  A pure client/server
model based on requests and results is not powerful enough to leave the
prolog side managing all the application specific work of this example:
some java specific stuff is needed to catch and manipulate properly the
events thrown by the graphical user interface.  This problem can be
solved in a distributed context, on which both languages are clients and
servers simultaneously, and can perform requests and do actions at a
time.  Using this model, the prolog side can add a prolog goal as
listener of a specific event, and the java side launches that goal when
the event raises.

In any case, the client/server approach simplifies the design of the
interface, so both interfaces have been designed in such way, but
keeping in mind that the goal is to reach a distributed environment, so
each side do the things it is best designed for.

Prolog to Java interface
************************

Author(s): Jesu's Correas.

This module defines the Ciao Prolog to Java interface.  This interface
allows a Prolog program to start a Java process, create Java objects,
invoke methods, set/get attributes (fields), and handle Java events.

This interface only works with JDK version 1.2 or higher.

Although the Java side interface is explained in Javadoc format (it is
available at 'library/javall/javadoc/' in your Ciao installation), the
general interface structure is detailed here.

Prolog to Java Interface Structure
==================================

This interface is made up of two parts: a Prolog part and a Java part,
running in separate processes.  The Prolog part receives requests from a
Prolog program and sends them to the Java part through a socket.  The
Java part receives requests from the socket and performs the actions
included in the requests.

If an event is thrown in the Java side, an asynchronous message must be
sent away to the Prolog side, in order to launch a Prolog goal to handle
the event.  This asynchronous communication is performed using a
separate socket.  The nature of this communication needs the use of
threads both in Java and Prolog: to deal with the 'sequential program
flow,' and other threads for event handling.

In both sides the threads are automatically created by the context of
the objects we use.  The user must be aware that different requests to
the other side of the interface could run concurrently.

Prolog side of the Java interface
---------------------------------

The Prolog side receives the actions to do in the Java side from the
user program, and sends them to the Java process through the socket
connection.  When the action is done in the Java side, the result is
returned to the user Prolog program, or the action fails if there is any
problem in the Java side.

Prolog data representation of Java elements is very simple in this
interface.  Java primitive types such as integers and characters are
translated into the Prolog corresponding terms, and even some Java
objects are translated in the same way (e.  g.  Java strings).  Java
objects are represented in Prolog as compound terms with a reference id
to identify the corresponding Java object.  Data conversion is made
automatically when the interface is used, so the Prolog user programs do
not have to deal with the complexity of these tasks.

Java side
---------

The Java side of this layer is more complex than the Prolog side.  The
tasks this part has to deal with are the following:

   * Wait for requests from the Prolog side.

   * Translate the Prolog terms received in the Prolog 'serialized' form
     to a more useful Java representation (see the Java interface
     documentation available at 'library/javall/javadoc/' in your Ciao
     installation for details regarding Java representation of Prolog
     terms).

   * Interpret the requests received from the Prolog side, and execute
     them.

   * Handle the set of objects created by or derived from the requests
     received from the prolog side.

   * Handle the events raised in the Java side, and launch the listeners
     added in the prolog side.

   * Handle the exceptions raised in the Java side, and send them to the
     Prolog side.

In the implementation of the Java side, two items must be carefully
designed: the handling of Java objects, and the representation of prolog
data structures.  The last item is specially important because all the
interactions between Prolog and Java are made using Prolog structures,
an easy way to standardize the different data management in both sides.
Even the requests themselves are encapsulated using Prolog structures.
The overload of this encapsulation is not significant in terms of socket
traffic, due to the optimal implementation of the prolog serialized
term.

The java side must handle the objects created from the Prolog side
dinamically, and these objects must be accessed as fast as possible from
the set of objects.  The Java API provides a powerful implementation of
Hash tables that achieves all the requirements of our implementation.

On the other hand, the java representation of prolog terms is made using
the inheritance of java classes.  In the java side there exists a
representation of a generic prolog term, implemented as an abstract
class in java.  Variables, atoms, compound terms, lists, and numeric
terms are classes in the java side which inherit from the term class.
Java objects can be seen also under the prolog representation as
compound terms, where the single argument corresponds to the Hash key of
the actual java object in the Hash table referred to before.  This
behaviour makes the handling of mixed java and prolog elements easy.
Prolog goals are represented in the java side as objects which contain a
prolog compound term with the term representing the goal.  This case
will be seen more in depth in next chapter, where the java to prolog
interface is explained.

Java event handling from Prolog
===============================

Java event handling is based on a delegation model since version 1.1.x.
This approach to event handling is very powerful and elegant, but a user
program cannot handle all the events that can arise on a given object:
for each kind of event, a listener must be implemented and added
specifically.  However, the Java 2 API includes a special listener
('AWTEventListener') that can manage the internal java event queue.

The prolog to java interface has been designed to emulate the java event
handler, and is also based on event objects and listeners.  The prolog
to java interface implements its own event manager, to handle those
events that have prolog listeners associated to the object that raises
the event.  From the prolog side can be added listeners to objects for
specific events.  The java side includes a list of goals to launch from
the object and event type.

Due to the events nature, the event handler must work in a separate
thread to manage the events asynchronously.  The java side has its own
mechanisms to work this way.  The prolog side must be implemented
specially for event handling using threads.  The communication between
java and prolog is also asynchronous, and an additional socket stream is
used to avoid interferences with the main socket stream.  The event
stream will work in this implementation only in one way: from java to
prolog.  If an event handler needs to send back requests to java, it
will use the main socket stream, just like the requests sent directly
from a prolog program.

The internal process of register a Prolog event handler to a Java event
is shown in the next figure:

[ciao_java.cachedoc/texinfo/ip2jbn-events-pl-reg_autofig]
When an event raises, the Prolog to Java interface has to send to the
Prolog user program the goal to evaluate.  Graphically, the complete
process takes the tasks involved in the following figure:

[ciao_java.cachedoc/texinfo/ip2jbn-events-pl-fire_autofig]
Java exception handling from Prolog
===================================

Java exception handling is very similar to the peer prolog handling: it
includes some specific statements to trap exceptions from user code.  In
the java side, the exceptions can be originated from an incorrect
request, or can be originated in the code called from the request.  Both
exception types will be sent to prolog using the main socket stream,
allowing the prolog program manage the exception.  However, the first
kind of exceptions are prefixed, so the user program can distinguish
them from the second type of exceptions.

In order to handle exceptions properly using the prolog to java and java
to prolog interfaces simultaneously, in both sides of the interface
those exceptions coming from their own side will be filtered: this
avoids an endless loop of exceptions bouncing from one side to another.

 -- PREDICATE: java_add_listener/3:

     Usage:

     Adds a listener to an event on an object.  Given a Java object
     reference, it registers the goal received as third argument to be
     launched when the Java event raises.
        - Call and exit should be compatible with:

          'Arg1' is a java object (a structure with functor
          '$java_object', and argument an integer given by the java
          side).  (javart:java_object/1)

          'Arg2' is a java event represented as an atom with the full
          event constructor name (e.g.,
          'java.awt.event.ActionListener').  (javart:java_event/1)

          'Arg3' is a prolog predicate.  Prolog term that represents the
          goal that must be invoked when the event raises on the object.
          The predicate arguments can be java objects, or even the
          result of java methods.  These java objects will be evaluated
          when the event raises (instead of when the listener is added).
          The arguments that represent java objects must be instantiated
          to already created objects.  The variables will be kept
          uninstantiated when the event raises and the predicate is
          called.  (javart:prolog_goal/1)
        - The following properties should hold at call time:

          'Arg1' is a java object (a structure with functor
          '$java_object', and argument an integer given by the java
          side).  (javart:java_object/1)

          'Arg2' is a java event represented as an atom with the full
          event constructor name (e.g.,
          'java.awt.event.ActionListener').  (javart:java_event/1)

          'Arg3' is a prolog predicate.  Prolog term that represents the
          goal that must be invoked when the event raises on the object.

          called.  (javart:prolog_goal/1)

     Meta-predicate with arguments: 'java_add_listener(?,?,goal)'.


 -- PREDICATE: java_remove_listener/3:

     Usage:

     It removes a listener from an object event queue.  Given a Java
     object reference, goal registered for the given event is removed.
        - Call and exit should be compatible with:

          'Arg1' is a java object (a structure with functor
          '$java_object', and argument an integer given by the java
          side).  (javart:java_object/1)

          'Arg2' is a java event represented as an atom with the full
          event constructor name (e.g.,

Java to Prolog interface
************************

Author(s): Jesu's Correas.

This module defines the Prolog side of the Java to Prolog interface.
This side of the interface only has one public predicate: a server that
listens at the socket connection with Java, and executes the commands
received from the Java side.

In order to evaluate the goals received from the Java side, this module
can work in two ways: executing them in the same engine, or starting a
thread for each goal.  The easiest way is to launch them in the same
engine, but the goals must be evaluated sequentially: once a goal
provides the first solution, all the subsequent goals must be finished
before this goal can backtrack to provide another solution.  The Prolog
side of this interface works as a top-level, and the goals partially
evaluated are not independent.

The solution of this goal dependence is to evaluate the goals in a
different prolog engine.  Although Ciao includes a mechanism to evaluate
goals in different engines, the approach used in this interface is to
launch each goal in a different thread.

The decision of what kind of goal evaluation is selected is done by the
Java side.  Each evaluation type has its own command terms, so the Java
side can choose the type it needs.

A Prolog server starts by calling the 'prolog_server/0' predicate, or by
calling 'prolog_server/1' predicate and providing the port number as
argument.  The user predicates and libraries to be called from Java must
be included in the executable file, or be accesible using the built-in
predicates dealing with code loading.

Documentation on exports
========================

 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/0:

     Usage:

     Prolog server entry point.  Reads from the standard input the node
     name and port number where the java client resides, and starts the
     prolog server listening at the jp socket.  This predicate acts as a
     server: it includes an endless read-process loop until the
     'prolog_halt' command is received.

     However, from the low-level communication point of view, this
     Prolog server actually works as a client of the Java side.  This
     means that Java side waits at the given port to a Prolog server
     trying to create a socket; Prolog side connects to that port, and
     then waits for Java requests (acting as a 'logical' server).  To
     use this Prolog server as a real server waiting for connections at
     a given port, use 'prolog_server/1'.


 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/1:

     Usage:

     Waits for incoming Java connections to act as a Prolog goal server
     for Java requests.This is the only 'prolog_server/*' predicate that
     works as a true server: given a port number, waits for a connection
     from Java and then serves Java requests.  When a termination
     request is received, finishes the connection to Java and waits next
     Java connection request.  This behaviour is different with respect
     to previous versions of this library.  To work as before, use
     'prolog_server/2'.

     Although it currently does not support simultaneous Java
     connections, some work is being done in that direction.
        - Call and exit should be compatible with:

          'Arg1' is an atom.  (basic_props:atm/1)

 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/2:

     Usage:

     Prolog server entry point.  Given a network 'node' and a 'port'
     number, starts the prolog server trying to connect to Java side at
     that 'node:port' address, and then waits for Java requests.  This
     predicate acts as a server: it includes an endless read-process
     loop until the 'prolog_halt' command is received.

     However, from the low-level communication point of view, this
     Prolog server actually works as a client of the Java side.  This
     means that Java side waits at the given port to a Prolog server
     trying to create a socket; Prolog side connects to that port, and
     then waits for Java requests (acting as a 'logical' server).  To
     use this Prolog server as a real server waiting for connections at
     a given port, use 'prolog_server/1'.
        - Call and exit should be compatible with:

          'Arg1' is an atom.  (basic_props:atm/1)

          'Arg2' is an atom.  (basic_props:atm/1)

 -- PREDICATE: shell_s/0:

     Usage:

     Command execution loop.  This predicate is called when the
     connection to Java is established, and performs an endless loop
     processing the commands received.  This predicate is only intended
     to be used by the Prolog to Java interface and it should not be
     used by a user program.

 -- PREDICATE: query_solutions/2:
     No further documentation available for this predicate.  The
     predicate is of type concurrent.


 -- PREDICATE: query_requests/2:
     No further documentation available for this predicate.  The
     predicate is of type concurrent.


 -- PREDICATE: running_queries/2:
     No further documentation available for this predicate.  The
     predicate is of type concurrent.

Author(s): Jesu's Correas.

This module defines a low-level socket interface, to be used by javart
and jtopl.  Includes all the code related directly to the handling of
sockets.  This library should not be used by any user program, because
is a very low-level connection to Java.  Use 'javart' (Prolog to Java
interface) or 'jtopl' (Java to Prolog interface) libraries instead.
