In a first approach, any of the both one-way interfaces implement a pure client/server model: the server waits for a query, performs the received query and sleeps until the next query comes; the client starts the server, carries out the initial part of the job initiating all the conversations with the server, and requests the server to do some things sometimes."),p([]),string_esc("This model cannot handle correctly the tasks regarding an event oriented programming environment like java.

This problem can be solved in a distributed context, on which both languages are clients and servers simultaneously, and can perform requests and do actions at a time.
